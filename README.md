# Hi, I'm Jean 👋

**AI/LLM Security Engineer | Red Team for AI Systems | AI Risk Assessment & Insurability**

I specialize in the adversarial testing of AI systems and the translation of technical AI security risks into business-critical governance frameworks. My work focuses on building attack chains for Large Language Models (LLMs), designing sophisticated guardrail bypass techniques, and creating risk assessment frameworks that determine whether AI systems are safe enough to insure, deploy, and trust.

Currently: AI Security Researcher & Practitioner | AI/LLM Red Teaming | NIST AI RMF & ISO/IEC 27001

## 🎯 What I'm Working On

*   🛡️ Developing **automated red teaming frameworks** for multi-agent systems.
*   🔍 Researching **indirect prompt injection** vulnerabilities in RAG-based architectures.
*   📊 Building a **quantitative AI risk scoring engine** for insurance readiness.
*   🌱 Exploring **policy-as-code** for real-time LLM guardrail enforcement.

## 💼 Core Competencies

### **AI/LLM Red Teaming & Adversarial Testing**
I conduct deep-dive security assessments of AI models, focusing on prompt injection, jailbreaking, and model guardrail bypass strategies. My expertise includes developing multi-step attack chains and identifying vulnerabilities in tool-calling and agentic memory systems.

### **AI Risk Assessment & Insurability Engineering**
I bridge the gap between technical vulnerabilities and business risk. I develop scoring frameworks based on NIST AI RMF and ISO 42001 to evaluate the security posture of LLMs, providing actionable insights for pre-deployment and insurance readiness.

### **AI Governance & Auditability**
I implement policy-driven security architectures, using policy-as-code to enforce guardrails and ensure regulatory alignment with frameworks like the EU AI Act. My work includes creating automated compliance checking and explainability frameworks for black-box models.
