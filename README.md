# Hi, I'm Jean 👋

**AI/LLM Security Engineer | Red Team for AI Systems | AI Risk Assessment & Insurability**

I specialize in adversarial testing of AI systems and translating AI security risks into 
business-critical governance frameworks. I build attack chains for LLMs, design guardrail 
bypass techniques, and create risk assessment frameworks that determine whether AI systems 
are safe enough to insure, deploy, and trust.
